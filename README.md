# BONK

## Purpose
**BONK!** is a Windows app based on various psychological studies. It is best used while studying to help you improve information retention.

It's purpose is to occasionally remind you to drink water, sit up straight, and relax a bit.

To explain each component:
The images are meant to make you more analytical, or group-oriented, happy, etc- even if they are only in your peripheral vision and not noticed.
The words of affirmation are simply meant as an emotional pick-me-up. I don't really have any evidence to back them.
The random interruptions are meant to disrupt your day-to-day cognition to allow you to think outside of the box or retain information better.

## Installation
